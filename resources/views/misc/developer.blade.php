        <p>
          Hi! My name is Harry Meas and I am full-stack web developer. After working in the web development
          industry for 7 years, I've decided to enroll at 
          <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/" target="_blank">Western Governors University</a>. 
          As part of the 
          <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/software-development-bachelors-program.html" target="_blank">
            BS in Software Development program
          </a>
          , students are taught to think critically,
          not only when writing code but in terms of business, management and professionalism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Goo Goo Data is my Capstone project to showcase what I've learned throughout the Software Development program.
          I hope you find it useful and thank you for visiting the site.

          Cheers!
